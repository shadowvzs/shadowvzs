I'm a software engineer who is passionate about using JavaScript, newer technologies, and interesting architectures on frontend but let's go back a bit in time on my timeline because this was a long journey and officially started only in 2018 January (wasted a lot of time in my early life on video games), but let's go step by step.

#### üêå Episode 1: The journey begins
**Tech stack:** *QBasic, Visual Basic, Wap, JASS, PHP (data packing/socket), JS, CSS, HTML, MySQL, ubuntu*
- '98 and early '00: I started to play with [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic)
   - I did snake, asteroid hunter, ping pong like mini-games, creating blur/grayscale effects with pixel color calculation and some other thing, but it was just for fun, only for learning
- Early '00: Another fun time was the HexView period when we edited the save game files with **HexEditor**
   - this was not part of the development still was a very fun time when edited the Settler2, NFS5 and other saved files
- '04: MS-DOS started to be faded away and windows 95/98 (SE) and later XP became more used OS so i jumped into [Visual Basic 6.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic))
   - I enjoyed, creating interfaces after [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS), it was something new, however, I did not go too deep into this, I usually created some file management apps, for example, the [logger manager](https://forum.ragezone.com/f196/muonline-log-file-size-screen-338390/) for [MU Online game server](https://forum.ragezone.com/f198/)
- '06: Age of [Wap](http://csc.columbusstate.edu/summers/Research/Wireless/WAPvsWeb.html), XHTML and [Netscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Communicator) - Web builder
   - First time when I jumped into web development, still was no CSS in use and and Javascript was less known but the Wap beign a well used technology here, for mobile chats, for listing files on host, basic blogs and presenation sites etc sadly most of host what i used from that period already gone
- '12: [Warcraft 3 - TFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_III:_The_Frozen_Throne) period, Blizzard's [World Editor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_III_World_Editor) was allowed to use a language (called JASS) for building more interactive games. 
JASS was a revolutionary improvement in map generation, based on events/trigger/action/functions, the first time when I met with the memory leaks, network desyncronization issue, overall it was a nice high level language, with events (keyboard, mouse etc), functions, variables, timers, hashtables, and so on and it made it available to convert the strategy to any other kind of game like MMORPG/RPG/TD/MOBA - example my [RPG map engine](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/mui-full-screen-inventory-and-shop-custom-item.230191/) with his own item/inventory system.
- '12: First web page with PHP, HTML, CSS and JS, it was a presentation site
- '16: [Perfect World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_World_(video_game)) Server + [Item Builder](https://github.com/shadowvzs/pwAdmin): 
   - First time when i met with ubuntu (was love in first sight) and installed a game into virtualBox ubuntu server, used MySQL, apache, tomcat, first time when i comunicated with server via PHP and socket, it was a fun project but better if I show the video about 
       - Where I started the [PHP pwAdmin](https://forum.ragezone.com/f752/php-based-pwadmin-1122225/) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if9Y9zaPHDQ) for it, later I shared the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/shadowvzs/pwAdmin) (well, I was a noob, it was poorly coded, but I learned a lot from it)
